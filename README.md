Stimuli, interface, and raw data processing for "Lexical and frequency effects on keystroke timing: Challenges to a lexical search account from a type-to-copy task," by Feldman, Dale, and van Rij.

* Stimuli: Folder containing target stimuli for the 3 experiments, including stimulus details

* Code: R code that cleans the raw data generated by the JS code and the PHP server-side storage

* Web Interface: The JS library that records keystrokes, and PHP code that saves data. Note that folder "data" needs write permission on server to store data.
